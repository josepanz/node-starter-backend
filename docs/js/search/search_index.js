(\\`.hbs\\` files): Handlebars templates for generating documentation pages\n- **Styles** (\\`.css\\` files): Stylesheets for customizing the appearance\n- **Scripts** (\\`.js\\` files): JavaScript files for additional functionality\n\n## Usage\n\n1. Extract this ZIP file to a directory on your system\n2. Use the \\`--templates\\` flag when running Compodoc to specify the path to your custom templates:\n\n   \\`\\`\\`bash\n   compodoc -p tsconfig.json --templates ./path/to/custom/templates/\n   \\`\\`\\`\n\n## Template Structure\n\n- \\`page.hbs\\` - Main page template\n- \\`partials/\\` - Directory containing partial templates\n- \\`styles/\\` - Directory containing CSS files\n- \\`js/\\` - Directory containing JavaScript files\n\n## Customization Tips\n\n1. **Templates**: Use Handlebars syntax to customize the HTML structure\n2. **Styles**: Modify CSS to change colors, fonts, layout, etc.\n3. **Scripts**: Add custom JavaScript functionality\n\n## Backup\n\nAlways keep a backup of your original templates before making changes.\n\n## Documentation\n\nFor more information about customizing Compodoc templates, visit:\nhttps://compodoc.app/guides/template-customization.html\n\nGenerated by Compodoc Template Playground\n`;\n  }\n\n  private downloadBlob(blob: Blob, filename:

NestJS y TypeScript\nÚltima actualización:  04 de noviembre de 2025, 04:50 p. m.\n🗎 Documentación disponible en\n\n\nEl proyecto expone dos tipos principales de documentación:\n\nSwagger (API): Documentación interactiva de todos los endpoints.\n\nRuta de acceso: /node-starter-backend/api/swagger\nEjemplo Local: http://localhost:3000/node-starter-backend/api/swagger\n\n\nCompodoc (Código): Documentación estática de módulos, controladores, providers, etc.\n\nRuta de acceso: /node-starter-backend/api/docs\nEjemplo Local: http://localhost:3000/node-starter-backend/api/docs\n\n\n\n\nReemplaza http://localhost:3000 con el dominio y puerto de tu entorno (DEV, QA, PROD) para acceder a la documentación remota.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n🛠️ Instalación y Dependencias\nEsta aplicación utiliza pnpm como gestor de paquetes para una gestión eficiente de dependencias.\n\nInstalar pnpm globalmente (si aún no lo tienes):\nExample :npm install -g pnpm\nInstalar todas las dependencias del proyecto:\nExample :pnpm install\nConfiguración del Entorno:\nCrea un archivo .env en la raíz del proyecto y define las variables de entorno necesarias (ej: DATABASE_URL, JWT_SECRET, etc.).\n\nOpcionales:\n\nSi se quiere generar documentación de compodocs (docs/documentation.json) y actualizar archivo readme en base a este pnpm docs:update-readme\nSi se quiere generar documentación de compodocs con htmls (docs/*) pnpm docs:generate\n\n\nCompilar y ejecutar:\n\nDesarrollo (watch):\n\nExample :pnpm run start:dev\nProducción:\n\nExample :pnpm run buildExample :pnpm run start:prod\n\n\n📦 Prisma\n\n\n💾 Configuración de Prisma (Base de Datos)\nPara interactuar con la base de datos a través de Prisma, sigue estos pasos:\n\nInstalar dependencias de desarrollo y el cliente (ya incluido en pnpm install, pero listado para referencia):\nExample :pnpm install prisma @prisma/client\nInicializar Prisma (crea prisma/schema.prisma y .env):\nExample :pnpm prisma init\nConfigurar tu base de datos en .env (con DATABASE_URL) y definir tus modelos en prisma/schema.prisma.\n\nGenerar el Cliente de Prisma:\nSiempre que modifiques el esquema, debes regenerar el cliente:\nExample :pnpm prisma generate\nCrear y Aplicar una Migración:\nPara sincronizar el esquema con la base de datos:\nExample :pnpm prisma migrate dev --name \n\n\n\n📦 Dependencias\n\n\n@autotelic/pino-seq-transport ^0.1.0\n@nestjs/axios ^4.0.0\n@nestjs/common ^11.0.1\n@nestjs/config ^4.0.1\n@nestjs/core ^11.0.1\n@nestjs/jwt
